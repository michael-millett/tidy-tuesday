# Groundhog predictions

Happy Groundhog Day! This week we're exploring Groundhog Day Predictions from [groundhog-day.com](https://groundhog-day.com)!
See if you can find a better way to present the annual data than their [table of predictions by year](https://groundhog-day.com/predictions)!
For anyone not familiar with the Groundhog Day tradition, if the groundhog sees its shadow and goes back into its burrow, that is a prediction of six more weeks of winter.
Otherwise spring will come early.
We attempted to provide weather data to accompany this dataset, but so far we've been unsuccessful.
Watch for a follow-up dataset in the future!

Note: "Oil Springs Ollie" (groundhog #55) has been succeeded by "Heaven's Wildlife Harvey" (groundhog #70).
