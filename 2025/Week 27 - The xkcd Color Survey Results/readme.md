# The xkcd Color Survey Results

In 2010, the [xkcd Color Survey](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/) asked hundreds of thousands of people to name colors they saw, revealing the different ways in which people perceive and label colors.

> Color is a really fascinating topic, especially since weâ€™re taught so many 
> different and often contradictory ideas about rainbows, different primary 
> colors, and frequencies of light.

Thank you to [Nicola Rennie](https://github.com/nrennie) for curating this week's dataset.
